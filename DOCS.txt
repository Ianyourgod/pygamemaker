Welcome to the docs!

This is where I will be writing down all the features.

Let's get started!

EXAMPLE:
import game, random, time
wn = game.screen(30, 30)
#calling the screen, player and objects
ob1 = game.obj(9, 30, 9, 30, "purple")#starting top left x and y coordinate and bottom right x and y coordinate
ob2 = game.obj(20, 30, 30, 30, "red")
p1 = game.player(1, 28, 3, 30)
df, rt, vel = 0, .1, 0# gravity variables
def grav(): # just making a bit more realisitc
    global df, rt, vel
    if not (p1.touEg("bottom") or p1.touching(ob2, 1)):
        vel += rt
        rt += .02
    else:
        vel = 0
        rt = .1
        df = 0
    df += vel
    if df > 1:
        df -= 1
        p1.down()
while True: #game loop
    wn.update()
    grav()
    inp = game.getinp(1) #geting player input
    if inp == "w" and (p1.touEg("bottom") or p1.touching(ob2, 1)): #checking if on ground or an object
        p1.up(1)
    elif inp == "a":
        p1.left()
    elif inp == "s":
        p1.down()
    elif inp == "d":
        p1.right()
    if p1.touching(ob1):
        p1.goto(1, 28) #if touching death thing go back to spawn
        
So, you probably didn't understand that, but you might after this!

The first thing you need to know is to call your screen
To do that just call a variable to be screen with it's x dimension and y dimension and on optional color variable screen(x dimension, y dimension, option color)
Next call your player.
Same thing except you give it it's top left x and y and it's bottom right x and y player(x, y, x, y)
An object is the exact same but you can add an optional color variable obj(x, y, x, y, option color)

SCREEN SECTION:
    __init__() # sets it up
    update() # updates the screen
    bgColor() # changes the background color
PLAYER SECTION:
    __init__() # sets it up
    left(optional amount) #moves left
    right(optional amount) #moves right
    up(optional amount) #moves up
    down(optional amount) # moves down
    goto(x, y) # moves to a specified x and y
    touching(object, optional extra distance) # checks if touching an object
    touEg(optional edge) #checks if touching a specified edge
    __del__() #runs when deleteing
OBJECT SECTION:
    __init__() # sets it up
    goto() # dont know if it works but moves to a specified x and y
OTHER COMMANDS:
    clear() #clears the console
    getinp() # gets player input without having to press enter
    
And that's it!
